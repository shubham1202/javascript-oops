/*******
 * In javascript the objects don't "own" methods. They have just properties, 
 * and any property could be a funcion. 
 * So, object re-creates the properties present inside constructor function
 * which is basically again and again creating same properties wheareas for different objects
 * whereas in other OOPs languages(C++, Java), the object shares the properties/methods 
 * present inside the class
